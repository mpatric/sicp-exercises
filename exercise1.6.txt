Exercise 1.6

(defn square[x] (* x x))
(defn abs[x] (if (< x 0.0) (- 0 x) x))
(defn average [x y] (/ (+ x y) 2))

(defn sqrt[x]  
  (defn improve [guess x] (average guess (/ x guess)))
  (defn good-enough? [guess x] (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
  (loop [guess 1.0]
    (if (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (recur (improve guess x)))))

Answer:

Very small numbers: will quickly pass the threshold of 0.0001 even when nowhere near the actual answer
Very large numbers: not enough precision
