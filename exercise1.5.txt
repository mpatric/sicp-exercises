Exercise 1.5

(define (p) (p))
(define (test x y) (if (= x 0) 0 y))
(test 0 (p))


Clojure:

(defn p [] (p))
(defn test [x y] (if (= x 0) 0 y))
(test 0 (p))


Applicative order:
  (test 0 (p))
  (test 0 (p))
  (test 0 (p))
  etc. (infinitely as (p) evaluates to (p))

Normal order:
  (test 0 (p))
  (if (= 0 0) 0 (p))
  0
  p is never called!
